This week, for some reason, we were not able to run our executable on the Linux machines. Instead, we created a bash script that successfully runs our executable. You can run our script by using the command 

`./runme` 

## File Structure
Everything for class is in the `Deliverable` directory.

Source code for each assignment is in its respective directory named as `assignment[index]`
